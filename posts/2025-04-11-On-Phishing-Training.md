<h1>The Regular Emsk Rant on Phishing Simulations</h1>

If you're here, you have either been exposed to <i>EmsK Rants About Phishing Simulations</i> before, or inexplicably the Internet has led you here. Welcome. 

Phishing training and/or phishing simulations. They're an inextricable part of the security landscape these days. Chances are you've been exposed to them, been asked to run them, and have strong opinions about them (what is a security person without strong opinions? do those even exist?) 

Let's look at the goals most orgs <i>say</i> they have.  
<ul><li>A more secure organisation.</li><li>Well educated end users</li><li><sub>Appeasing the various audit bodies, cyber insurers, and other bureaucratic behemoths overshadowing the day job.</sub></li></ul>

Nice goals; let's look at reality. 
<ul><li>People <s>are stupid</s> make mistakes.</li></ul>

<h2>You cannot train people out of human error.</h2>

Just witness every single IT Security person ever who's fallen for a phish, clicked on the "free things!" scam, had their credit card details lifted online...

"But the CIO says I have to run phishing simulations."

Well, yeah, of course they do. They're dealing with the aforementioned bureaucratic behemoths that all advocate phishing simulations.

"But my users are really smart!" 

Mate, so are mine.  And in every simulation campaign we've run since 2017, at least one person falls for it in under sixty seconds.  People are, first and foremost, PEOPLE. 

It is their JOB to read the emails in their inbox and click on the links.  It is their JOB to download that invoice from the supplier, to open the quotation, to read the document their colleague just sent them.  Phishing gets more and more believable every day. You know this. I know this. So why do we expect our end users to somehow magically get everything right? 

Those orgs who think that somehow they can train human error out, or worse, force punitive action on those employees who make mistakes, are doing it wrong. I will die on that hill.  

But, your CEO says you have to run phishing simulations, etc.  So, Instead of arguing about it, let's reframe it and get something useful out of it. 

Phishing simulations are great.  They prove to your business that, in fact, you are fallible humans just like all the other billions of fallible humans on the planet.  

The outcome of our campaigns (which we've run using one platform or another since 2018) tell us the following:
<ul><li></li>approx 30% of our people click the little "report message" button in Outlook.</li><li>approx [redacted]% depending of our people click the links.</li><li>approx [redacted]% of our people enter the creds.</li></ul>

This is consistent and reproducible every time. 

Why is this useful information?

Because the actual <i>math</i> has 5 people in my organisation, <b>every single day</b>, entering their credentials into a phishing email. 

Our successful simulated phishes include people from every level and role across the company. The C-suite, the newest of grads, seniors in the ICT team. No part of the business is immune from human error. 

"Hello, Finance Department, please provide monies so that defense in depth can continue to happen."

Phishing-resistant multifactor authentication. Endpoint protection. URL filtering. CASB. Your SIEM and SOC. Whatever it is that would <b>practically</b> enhance your security posture.  

And for the love of little apples, don't get punitive about it.  People are going to make mistakes. YOU are going to make mistakes. 

We're there to support the business.  Our security training - which every employee has to do as part of onboarding, and yearly as a refresher - focuses on that fact. We're there to HELP. TALK to us.  Use the button in Outlook. Pick up the phone.
