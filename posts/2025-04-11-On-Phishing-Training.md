#The Regular Emsk Rant on Phishing Simulations

If you're here, you have either been exposed to EmsK Rants About Phishing Simulations before, or inexplicably the Internet has led you here. Welcome. 

So, phishing, phishing training, phishing simulations.  They're an inextricable part of the security landscape these days. Chances are you've been exposed to them, been asked to run them, and have strong opinions about them (what is a security person without strong opinions? do those even exist?) 

Let's look at the goals most people say they have.  
<ul><li>A more secure organisation.</li><li>Well educated end users</li><li>Appeasing the various audit bodies, cyber insurers, and other bureaucratic behemoths overshadowing the day job.</li></ul>

Great.  What's the reality?
<ul><li>People <s>are stupid</s> make mistakes.</li><li>**We cannot train people out of human error.**</li></ul>
Just witness every single IT Security person ever who's fallen for a phish, clicked on the "free things!" scam, had their credit card details lifted online... 

Right, but the CIO says I have to run phishing simulations anyway. 

Great! Let's look at your _actual goals_. 
<ul><li>Understand the percentage of my organisation that will click on a phish when presented with one. </li><li>Knowing what percentage of my organisation will enter their credentials when presented with a phish.</li><li>Knowing what my organisation does with a phishing email when it arrives in their inbox. </li></ul>
